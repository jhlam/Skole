\chapter{Conclusion}
As we have shown in this report, there are multiple different algorithms to select the seed. Information diffusion can simulate different aspect of real life. The problem is very taxing on a normal home computer. BFS can be optimized, ICM is a special case of the BFS. There are different optimization, matrix multiplication, maybe something with hardware. 

The result we got from the simulation was somewhat surprising, the result from a similar simulation \cite{MaximizeSpread2003}. From \cite{MaximizeSpread2003} we see that the greedy algorithm is better then the other algorithm and the random algorithm performed the worst. For the simulation where the simulation runs until there are no more nodes to activate, the greedy algorithm performed the same as the other. This can be resulted by the stop criteria.

For the future work, it would be interesting to see if the matrix-vector multiplication can improve the seed selection algorithm or the information diffusion. One interesting aspect is to see if there are possible to improve it via some form of hardware solution.

Proposed solution, the modified matrix vector multiplication.

have a hardware design for it.

can compare with the cache oblivious sparce matrix multiplication.
