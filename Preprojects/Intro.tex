Using graphs as representation and algorithms that traverse graphs are common through many scientific domains\cite{HybridBFS2015}. We can use graph to simulate how a disease would spread through a social network, we can predict how efficient viral marketing is and we can see how a new trend would spread through a community\cite{MaximizeSpread2003}.To select an most influential node for a information diffusion through a social network is an NP-hard problem\cite{MaximizeSpread2003}. One of the common ways to select them, is by brute forcing through the network with algorithms like BFS. 

The problem that we will explore with this report, is if there is a way to optimize the seed-selection of the most influential nodes in a graph. The report will focus on how to use hardware to achieve an optimization to this problem. One idea is to try to use the irregular memory access that is requested during a BFS search.
