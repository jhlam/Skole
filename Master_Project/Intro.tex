\begin{list_type}  
\item Most real world graphs are sparse graph
\item Many real world applications can be converted to graph traversal
\item Many solution, Parralizatino, different structure, algorithms, harware implementation, etc \ldots 
\item Some of the current solution
\item why is it important to improve this type of problems
\item How can this benefit from improvement
\item how are we solving the problem
\item Why we choose our solution(hardware acceleration not really explored)
\item how the result was.
\item why use HLS(because an interesting solution, able to test multiple solution in a short implementation time.)
\end{list_type}

Most graph in the real world can be persived as a sparse matrix. We can see that in social network sites as twitter and facebook. Each users are a node and edges are connection between them. 

data diffusion is a special case of breadth first search. We can apply data diffusion in several area. Marketing and dieases spreading.
