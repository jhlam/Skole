\chapter{Related Work}  \label{relatedWork}


Here, we will give you a short overview of the current state regarding Information Diffusion, High Level Synthesis and different optimization options.

\begin{itemize}
  
\item Yamans paper, where there are some works that shows the solution i use
\item parallalization of the algorithm
\item maybe some examples of HLS to show that HLS is used.
\item showe that there are not many HLS implementation, recently matured. 
\item show that there are not many hardware implementation for information diffusion.
\item need to look through Yamans paper and get some refrences from there.
\item might be good to look at how this type of sparce matrix multiplication can be used
\item show other implementation of SPmv
\item Show some examples where image processing is done through vivado HLS.
\item \cite{HLSTutorial} A good paper showing the state of the art for HLS.

\end{itemize}

This chapter, we will look at the state of research regarding High Level Synthesis, network research regarding Information Diffusion, and Optimization of Independent cascade model and Breadth first search.

\section{Information Diffusion}
There are multiple studies done regarding Information Diffusion. One studies shows how information diffusion can be applied during an disease outbreak\cite{InformationDiffusionThroughBlogspace}, viral marketing\cite{ViralMarketing} and message passing\cite{Starbird:2012:RRI:2145204.2145212}.

\section{High Level Synthesis}
High Level Synthesis have getting more attention latelly, more active forums and recently, Vivado HLS became free for the public.
