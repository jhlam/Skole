\section{Motivation}
Information diffusion is a field of network research where a message, or data, is propagated through a network through edges. The message originates from a chosen set of nodes, known as \textit{seed nodes} and propagates through the network according to different models,\it{Independent Cascade Model} and \it{Linear Threshold Model}.  
High level synthesis take algorithms implemented in high level programming language such as C and C++ and and $synthesise$ the design to low level designs\citep{52214}.
