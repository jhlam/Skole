\section*{Abstract}


Information Diffusion are often used for different simulations in network research because it simulates how information propagetes thorough a network, from memes on the Internett, spreading of disease in populations, to viral marketing. Measuring spread and speed, we can find influential targets in the network, such targets are optimal targets to pass message during disaster scenario, vaccinate to prevent spreading of a disease, or even targets for viral marketing. 


High Level Synthesis have in recent years matured greatly. With HLS, designing custom architectures  is no longer a
