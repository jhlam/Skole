\begin{list_type}  
\item Yamans paper, where there are some works that shows the solution i use
\item parallalization of the algorithm
\item maybe some examples of HLS to show that HLS is used.
\item showe that there are not many HLS implementation, recently matured. 
\item show that there are not many hardware implementation for information diffusion.
\item need to look through Yamans paper and get some refrences from there.
\item might be good to look at how this type of sparce matrix multiplication can be used
\item show other implementation of SPmv
\item
