\chapter{Method} \label{methode}
- Start by creating pseudocode to illustrate how the Independent cascade model works and how to set up the code.
- Implement the algorithm(ICM) in C code, since High level synthesis synthesis C/C++ code. 
- Create test to make sure the code is correct. (Test early to catch problem early.)
- Port the code over to be high level synthesis compatiable. () 
- analyse the implementation.
- implement on Hardware.
- might want to implement wiwth interface, AXI 4 and stuff like that 


NOTES: 
For our example, a AXI4 Stream would be best i think.

implemented a 16-bit LFSR(linear feedback shift register) to generate the random number, which is used to calculate if the activation will take place.
each have a [5-25\%] activation rate. implemented some different models, use a array instead of a matrix. 

WE have created a generator following the R-mat generator for sparse graph for testing.
We implemented the simulation as a sparse matrix vector multiplication
we implemented that in vivado HLS. and synthesised it
We changed the implementation to accomodate the requirements for HLS; - no recursion, unknown matrix length and allocation of memory.
