\chapter{Method} \label{methode}
- Start by creating pseudocode to illustrate how the Independent cascade model works and how to set up the code.
- Implement the algorithm(ICM) in C code, since High level synthesis synthesis C/C++ code. 
- Create test to make sure the code is correct. (Test early to catch problem early.)
- Port the code over to be high level synthesis compatiable. () 
- implement on Hardware.



NOTES: 
For our example, a AXI4 Stream would be best i think.
